    <description>Headless Horsemini! We didn't forget him!

The Headless Horsemini is a tiny version of... you can guess who. The body and head act independently; the head will shoot a triple spread of tears and charge across the screen at enemies, whilst the body will spawn flies at random! You can find this inseparable pair in Treasure rooms!
