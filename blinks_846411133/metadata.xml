    <description>Blank bombs ain't your thing? How about Blinks! 

Blinks are an active item you can find in shops that open secret room doors, and clear the screen of bullets whenever you want! Neat! 
However, you get 3 charges per floor that cannot be replenished at all until you go down to the next floor, where you're given 3 new ones to play with!
