    <description>Mulligrims! More Grimaces.

This mod adds some simple new monster variants to the game: Mulligrims and Nest Grimaces! These Grimaces cough up flies and spiders respectively until the room is cleared! There is a limit on how many flies and spiders they can spawn, so you won't get too overwhelmed! They have a small chance to replace any other existing grimace.
