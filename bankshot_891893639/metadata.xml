    <description>Bank shot! Billiard tears.

Bank shot is an item that makes it so Isaac's tears never drop out of the air and instead, will come to a halt when they hit their max range. It also makes it so your tears now collide with each other with a satisfying clack, letting you ricochet tears off each other into enemies, or fill the room with tears and push them into em! You can find this item in Treasure Rooms.
